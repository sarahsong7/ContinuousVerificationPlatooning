This repository provides raw data used in the paper 
"Continuous Verification with Acknowledged MAPE-K Pattern and Time Logic-based Slicing: A platooning System of Systems Case Study".
Related tools include the PRISM model checker (https://github.com/prismmodelchecker/prism.git) and the platooning simulator (https://github.com/KAIST-SE-Lab/StarPlateS).
The Original folder is the data obtained from the existing simulator.
The CVplatooning folder is data obtained by improving the existing simulator.
Finally, the slicing folder provides the existing model verification results and model slicing verification results.
